# phil-docstrings

Phillp Docstrings is a lightweight app to fill docstrings in Python functions and classes using LLMs.

The package uses [ast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) from the standard library to parse files, while Google Gemini is used as the LLM to generate docstrings.

This project was made to practice working with LLM APIs.

**Note:** Google _used_ to have a generous Gemini API free tier, but this has now been reduced.
